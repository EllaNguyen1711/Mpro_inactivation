- The starting input files including molecular dynamics simulations are available at MolSSI: https://covid.molssi.org//simulations/#foldinghome-simulations-of-nsp5-dimer
- Simulation data labeled 'PROJ14234', 'PROJ14542', and 'PROJ14543' were used in this analysis. 
- The code has been organized and numbered to match the intended order of execution. A clearer understanding of how to use this code can be gained by reading the "Method" description published in our manuscript [doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01518](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01518)
